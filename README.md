# musical_play_list
in this program, we simulate a musical play list to manage our musics.
we don't play musics. we just say which music should be played, but 
by adding proper libraries for each music player, e.g: vlc media player, 
we can play musics.
this project is as my assignment for data structures course in 
University of Isfahan  tought by Dr.Afsaneh Fatemi.
